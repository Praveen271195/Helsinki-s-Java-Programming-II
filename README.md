<h1 align="center">Solutions to the Helsinki's Mooc Part II on Java ☕ </h1>

## Motivation:
This repository was created to help the beginners who are stuck up somewhere with the projects/excercises for practice provided by Helsinki’s Java Mooc. 

## About Helsinki’s Course:
University of Helsinki’s provides a free massive open online course (MOOC) on programming. You can find an updated version of their popular course Object-Oriented Programming with Java. The link to their website is provided below under the credits section. During this course, you will learn the basics of computer programming, along with algorithms and object-oriented programming through the Java programming language. I have had a great experience using their resources to learn Java. The course includes comprehensive materials and plenty of programming exercises - all of which are tested using their automatic testing service "Test My Code". I will recommend the beginner to Computer Science and also the induviduals who are looking to upgrade their skills to sign up with their free course.
